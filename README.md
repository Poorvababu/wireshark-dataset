# wireshark-dataset
Dataset consisting of encrypted, normal, malicious encrypted and malicious normal packets.
The dataset is generated specifically for this study by transmitting different types of packets such as encrypted, unencrypted normal packets, encrypted and unencrypted malicious packets over our college network and capturing those packets based on the ip address from which they are sent and the time using Wireshark tool.The various features of each packet captured is analysed and the attribute reduction is done to obtain better performance results. Weka tool has been used for the purpose of feature reduction and the attributes considered are given in the table below.
Total number of instances in this dataset :1130 .
Number of attributes : 10.
Area: Data packets captured in the network
Attribute characteristics: Integer, decimal and nominal values.
